# Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in different programming languages.

## Structures

| Structure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Arrays | Ordered collection of elements of the same type, accessible by index. They are efficient in terms of element access but have a fixed size. |
| Linked Lists | Sequence of linked nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. They come in various forms like singly linked, doubly linked, and circular linked lists. |
| Stacks | Collection of elements where the last added element is the first to be removed (LIFO). They are used to implement features like undo in text editors. |
| Queues | Collection of elements where the first added element is the first to be removed (FIFO). They are used in situations like task management in a system. |
| Trees | Hierarchical structure where each node has a parent and zero or more children. Binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees are common examples. |
| Graphs | Set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges (edges). They are used to model complex relationships and problems like shortest path traversal. |
| Maps / Dictionaries | Structures that associate unique keys with values. They allow fast value lookup using keys, like in Python's dict or Java's HashMap. |
| Sets | Collection of unique elements without specific order. They are used to check for element existence and remove duplicates. |
| Heaps | Tree-like data structures used to maintain the minimum (or maximum) element at the top. They are useful in priority search algorithms. |
| Hash Tables | Structures that implement a hash map, allowing fast access to associated values through keys. They are used in database implementation and efficient search problem resolution. |

## Advantages / Disadvantages
| Data Structure | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arrays | Efficient storage and retrieval of data, effective processing of small and large amounts of data, manipulation of large amounts of data can be carried out easily, well-organized approach for operations like storage, addition, retrieval, manipulation, deletion | Fixed size, inefficient for insertion and deletion operations |
| Linked Lists | Dynamic size, efficient insertion and deletion operations, easy to implement | Inefficient for random access operations |
| Stacks | LIFO structure is useful in implementing features like undo in text editors | Limited functionality compared to other data structures |
| Queues | FIFO structure is useful in situations like task management in a system | Limited functionality compared to other data structures |
| Trees | Efficient searching and sorting operations, hierarchical structure allows for easy organization of data | Complex implementation compared to other data structures |
| Graphs | Useful in modeling complex relationships and problems like shortest path traversal | Complex implementation compared to other data structures |
| Maps / Dictionaries | Fast value lookup using keys, well-tested and proven structures that can be relied on by programmers | Limited functionality compared to other data structures |
| Sets | Efficient removal of duplicates and checking for element existence | Limited functionality compared to other data structures |
| Heaps | Useful in priority search algorithms, maintains the minimum (or maximum) element at the top | Limited functionality compared to other data structures |
| Hash Tables | Fast access to associated values through keys, used in database implementation and efficient search problem resolution | Complex implementation compared to other data structures |
